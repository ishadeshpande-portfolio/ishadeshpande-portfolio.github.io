# E-commerce Platform

## Overview

This project is a full-stack e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete the checkout process. It includes both customer-facing features and an admin dashboard for managing products and orders.

## Technologies Used

- React for the frontend
- Node.js and Express for the backend
- MongoDB for the database
- Redux for state management
- Stripe for payment processing
- JWT for authentication

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Product catalog with search and filter functionality
- Shopping cart
- Checkout process with Stripe integration
- Admin dashboard for managing products and orders
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing real-time inventory management to prevent overselling. I solved this by using MongoDB transactions to ensure atomicity when updating inventory during the checkout process.

Another challenge was optimizing the performance of the product catalog for a large number of items. I implemented server-side pagination and indexing in MongoDB to improve query performance.

## Outcome

The result is a fully functional e-commerce platform that provides a smooth shopping experience for customers and an efficient management system for administrators. The project demonstrates my ability to work with both frontend and backend technologies to create a complete web application.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a recommendation system based on user browsing history
- Add a review and rating system for products
- Integrate with multiple payment gateways for more payment options

This project significantly improved my skills in full-stack development and gave me valuable experience in creating a complex, real-world application.
